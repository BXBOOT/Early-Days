<h1>This is my first attempt at anything HTML.<br> This text is larger than the next line because it is heading 1</h1>

<h6>This is smaller text because it is the smallest heading, heading 6</h6>

<p>Within a paragraph, we can type in a paragraph of text and use other tags to move from one part og the page to another, or use external links.
For example to visit an exernal page, opening in the same window, 
<a href="https://www.canadianbusinesscollege.com">visit Canadian Business College</a> will take us to the school website.<br>
To visit a site in a new tab window we must use target attribute. There are more examples of thow to do thisto open in new windows, frames, or the ful body of the window.
This will take us to a new window <a href="https://www.canadianbusinesscollege.com" target="_blank">visit our school.</a>

These are known as abslute URLs. A relative url will take us to a page within the same website. For now ths is a 1 page site, so will have to circle back to ths section.

<h3>Adding images will require a map to collect image from storage to display on the site.</h3>

<p>To add an image we use the img tag.
we also need to add the src attribute to collect the file from the path an then add an alternative name for the image by using alt.<br>
for example this image <img src="C:\Users\Michael\Desktop\First HTML Attempt\Images\Cat.jpg" alt="cat picture"></p>

<p> If you would like to contact us to complain about the cat picture, click here <a href="file:///C:/Users/Michael/Desktop/First%20HTML%20Attempt/contact%20form.html">contact form</a></p>

<p>This will take you to our media page.<a href="file:///C:/Users/Michael/Desktop/First%20HTML%20Attempt/media.html"> media page</a></p>

<p id="#para1">Using CSS, we have changed he colour on the background for all pages within this website, and made paragraphs follow rules also.
This paragragraph will follow different rues because we will give it an ID to distinguish it from the others.</p id="#para1">
